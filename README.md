### 1. Introduction
Optimizing user engagement on a website or platform is critical for business success. For startups, where resources are limited, understanding the impact of design changes on user behavior can significantly influence growth strategies. This study evaluates the effect of a redesigned landing page on user conversion rates. By analyzing data collected during an A/B test, we aim to determine whether the new design has a statistically significant impact on user conversions.

The dataset includes three key variables:
- **`treatment`**: Indicates whether the user was exposed to the new design (`yes`) or the old design (`no`).
- **`new_images`**: Indicates whether new images were used on the landing page (`yes` or `no`).
- **`converted`**: Binary variable indicating whether the user converted (`1`) or not (`0`).


### 2. Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
1. To determine if the redesigned landing page (`treatment = yes`) significantly increases the conversion rate compared to the original design (`treatment = no`).
2. To assess whether the presence of new images (`new_images = yes`) has any additional effect on conversion rates.
3. To provide actionable insights and recommendations for the business based on the findings.

### 3. Executive Summary
This study analyzed the impact of a redesigned landing page on user conversion rates using statistical methods. The results indicate that the new design led to a statistically significant increase in conversions (p-value = 0.025). However, the presence of new images did not have a significant effect on conversion rates (p-value = 0.888). Logistic regression confirmed these findings, with the odds ratio for the treatment group being 1.073, indicating a modest but meaningful improvement in conversion likelihood.

For the business, this suggests that the new design is effective and should be implemented across the platform. Future studies could explore other factors influencing conversion rates to further optimize the user experience.

### 4. Methodology
The analysis followed a structured approach:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Calculated summary statistics for conversion rates across combinations of `treatment` and `new_images`.
   - Checked the balance of `new_images` across treatment groups to ensure there were no confounding effects.

2. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Conducted a two-sample proportion test to compare conversion rates between the treatment and control groups.
   - Performed logistic regression to estimate the treatment effect while controlling for the potential influence of `new_images`.

3. **Interpretation**:
   - Interpreted the results of the statistical tests and regression model to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the redesigned landing page.

### 5. Insights

1. **Summary Statistics**:
   | Treatment | New Images | Converted |
   |-----------|------------|-----------|
   | no        | no         | 0.107104  |
   | no        | yes        | 0.112538  |
   | yes       | no         | 0.120047  |
   | yes       | yes        | 0.113724  |

   - Overall conversion rates:
     - Control group (`treatment = no`): 0.109821
     - Treatment group (`treatment = yes`): 0.1168855

2. **Balance Check**:
   | Treatment | New Images | Proportion |
   |-----------|------------|------------|
   | no        | no         | 0.5        |
   | no        | yes        | 0.5        |
   | yes       | no         | 0.5        |
   | yes       | yes        | 0.5        |

   - Since `new_images` is balanced, it does not confound the results.

3. **Two-Sample Proportion Test**:
   - Z-statistic: -2.242
   - P-value: 0.025
   - Conclusion: The difference in conversion rates between the treatment and control groups is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

4. **Logistic Regression**:
   | Variable           | Coefficient | Std Err | Z-value | P>|z| | Odds Ratio |
   |--------------------|-------------|---------|---------|------|------------|
   | Intercept          | -2.0904     | 0.027   | -76.314 | 0.000 | N/A        |
   | Treatment_yes      | 0.0703      | 0.031   | 2.242   | 0.025 | 1.073      |
   | New_images_yes     | -0.0044     | 0.031   | -0.141  | 0.888 | 0.996      |

   - The treatment group (`treatment_yes`) has a significant positive effect on conversion rates, with an odds ratio of 1.073. This means users exposed to the new design are 7.3% more likely to convert than those in the control group.
   - The presence of new images (`new_images_yes`) does not significantly affect conversion rates (p-value = 0.888).

### 6. Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Implement the Redesigned Landing Page**:
   - The new design significantly increases conversion rates. It should be rolled out across the platform to maximize user engagement and sign-ups.

2. **Focus on Other Design Elements**:
   - While the addition of new images did not significantly impact conversion rates, other design elements (e.g., layout, color schemes, call-to-action placement) could be tested to further improve performance.

3. **Monitor Post-Implementation Performance**:
   - Continuously monitor conversion rates after implementing the new design to ensure sustained improvements.

4. **Conduct Further Experiments**:
   - Explore other factors that may influence conversion rates, such as user demographics, device types, or time of day.


### 7. Conclusion
The redesigned landing page significantly improves user conversion rates, as evidenced by both the two-sample proportion test and logistic regression. The presence of new images, however, does not appear to have a meaningful impact. These findings provide clear guidance for the business to enhance its user acquisition strategy.


### 8. Future Studies
To build upon this study, consider the following areas for further research:
1. **Segmentation Analysis**:
   - Analyze conversion rates across different user segments (e.g., age, gender, location) to identify patterns and tailor designs accordingly.

2. **Longitudinal Impact**:
   - Study the long-term effects of the redesigned landing page on user retention and engagement.

3. **Multivariate Testing**:
   - Test multiple design elements simultaneously to identify the most impactful changes.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Use advanced models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict conversion probabilities and optimize the user journey.


### 9. Limitations of the Study
1. **Sample Size and Duration**:
   - The study duration and sample size may limit the generalizability of the results. Longer testing periods could provide more robust insights.

2. **External Factors**:
   - External factors such as seasonality, marketing campaigns, or competitor activity were not accounted for in this analysis.

3. **Confounding Variables**:
   - Although `new_images` was balanced, other unobserved variables might still influence conversion rates.

By addressing these limitations in future studies, the business can gain deeper insights into user behavior and optimize its growth strategies effectively.
